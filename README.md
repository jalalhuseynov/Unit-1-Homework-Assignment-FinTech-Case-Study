 Shapekay's major impact in Canadian Fintech industy is that they make it easy for Canadians to invest in cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum. Since Shakepay's incorporation year - 2015, bticoin increased approximately 21300% in dollar value. Since Bitcoin and Ethereum are having their all time high prices these days, we could say that Shakepay is serving their mission succesfully: "Creating open access to building wealth"

Cryptocurrency exchanges make a majority of their profits through exchange fees. However, Shakepay has a different approach. They are comission-free service. Shakepay describes itself as a local retail store that buys and sells goods. The main products are Ethereum and Bitcoin in Shakepay 'store'. They buy these cryptocurrencies from thier customers at relatively cheaper prices and resell them to earn a profit. The core metrics to measure success is their customers base and transaction volumes. The more customers using Shakepay and more volume of transactions ensures more profits. In terms of customers, Shakepay has over 800.000 customers which is approximately 2% of Canadians. At this time, there is no public information about company's financial performance. 


## Recommendations

The major disadvantage of Shakepay is the number of cryptocurrencies they offer on their plaform. While other local and global cryptocurrency exchanges such as; Coinsmart, Newton, Coinbase and Crypto.com offer more than a dozen available cryptocurrencies for their customers to buy/sell. In contrast, Shakepay only offers the two most known cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Due to the lack of diversified options, customers maybe inclined to use other platforms As such, to maintain profitability and grow their customer base, it would be highly recommended to add a larger number of cryptocurrencies available and perhaps exploring adding other digital assets to the Shakepay platform.

By offering more and newer cryptocurrencies the company can attract more customers. An enlarged user base will increase their trading volumes and consquently increase their profits. There are various cryptocurrencies and tokens that can be easily added to without the need for additional resourses. For instance, ERC20 standard tokens were created in the Ethereum network and run on the Etherum network. As such, these coins can be integrated into the platform that currently sells Etherum without much effort. However, integrating other blockchains such as Cardano, Solano, Polkadot may require more time and resources because they are based in other networks. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum will not be the only public blockchains that people will use. There are other networks such as Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche that are growing rapidly and are to stay for the long hau. That is why it is essential for their success to embrace these new blockchains. This will allow the company to maintain presence in a competitive and growing market.
