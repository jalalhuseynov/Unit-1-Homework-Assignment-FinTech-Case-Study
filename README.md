* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Shakepay is in blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Blockchain technology and WEB3 getting popular and companies and projects in this domain experience exponential growth. Public blockchains are building decentralized web infrastructures and there are many innovations happening in the domain. From the birth of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)to play-to-earn platforms, this domain is growing very fast.

## Results

* Shapekay's major impact in Canadian Fintech industy is that they make it easy for Canadians to invest in cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ethereum. Since Shakepay's incorporation year - 2015, bticoin increased approximately 21300% in dollar value. Since bitcoin and ethereum are having their all time high prices these days, we could say that Shakepay is serving their mission succesfully: "Creating open access to building wealth"

Cryptocurrency exchanges make major part of their profits from exchange fees. However, Shakepay has a different approach. They are comission-free service. Shakepay describes itself as a local retail store that buys and sells goods. The main products are ethereum and bitcoin at Shakepay 'store'. They buy these cryptocurrencies from customers at relatively cheaper prices and resells them to buys with profit. Core metrics to measure success in this domain are customers base and transaction volume. The more customers and more volume means more profits. In terms of customers, Shakepay has over 800.000 customers which are approximately 2% of Canadians. There are no public information about company's financial performance. 


## Recommendations

Major disadvantage of Shakepay relative to the competitors is a number of cryptocurrencies that are offered by company. While local cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinsmart and Newton, global exchanges such as Coinbase and Crypto.com offers over dozens cryptoucrrencies for customers to buy/sell, Shakepay only offers two major cryptocurrencies: bitcoin and ethereum. I would recommend company to explore possibility of adding other digital assets to the platform. 

By offering new cryptocurrencies company can attract more customers and also increase trading volume in the platform. More customers and more volume equals more profit. There various kinds of cryptocurrencies and tokens. For example, ERC20 standard tokens are easy to add to the platforms that support Ethereum network. Because ERC20 coins are built and run on Ethereum, it reuqires less resources to add it platform. Integrating other blockchains such as Cardano, Solano, Polkadot might require more time and resources. 
Bitcoin and ethereum will not be the only public blockchains that people will use. There are other networks such as Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche that are growing rapidly and they are here to stay along with Bitcoin and Ethereum. That is why embracing new blockchains would keep company competitive and might generate extra profits.
